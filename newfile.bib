	abstract = {A method is presented for simulating arrays of spatially varying ground motions, incorporating the effects of incoherence, wave passage, and differential site response. Non-stationarity is accounted for by considering the motions as consisting of stationary segments. Two approaches are developed. In the first, simulated motions are consistent with the power spectral densities of a segmented recorded motion and are characterized by uniform variability at all locations. Uniform variability in the array of ground motions is essential when synthetic motions are used for statistical analysis of the response of multiply-supported structures. In the second approach, simulated motions are conditioned on the segmented record itself and exhibit increasing variance with distance from the site of the observation. For both approaches, example simulated motions are presented for an existing bridge model employing two alternatives for modeling the local soil response: i) idealizing each soil-column as a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator, and ii) employing the theory of vertical wave propagation in a single soil layer over bedrock. The selection of parameters in the simulation procedure and their effects on the characteristics of the generated motions are discussed. The method is validated by comparing statistical characteristics of the synthetic motions with target theoretical models. Response spectra of the simulated motions at each support are also examined.

These earthquakes occurred within a zone of active crustal shortening accommodated by postulated blind thrust faults. Seismotectonic and structural analyses are used to evaluate the depth, geometry, and segmentation of thrust faults that were the probable sources of the 1892 earthquake sequence. Synthetic ground-motion modeling demonstrates that rupture of a 17-km-long segment of the thrust fault system can produce the magnitude and distribution of intensities documented from anecdotal accounts of the 19 April 1892 earthquake, including probable directivity effects east of the range front. Integrated structural and seismotectonic analyses also are used to interpret the role of inferred geometric segment boundaries in arresting the 19 April 1892 earthquake rupture, and the subsequent occurrence of the 21 April 1892 aftershock.},

Lessons learned from this earthquake are described and recommendations related to the design of curved and skewed bridges, design of bearings and devices to prevent girder collapse, and ductility of bridge piers are presented.

	title = {Next generation seismic fragility curves for {California} bridges incorporating the evolution in seismic design philosophy},
	abstract = {Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the seismic risk to highway bridges is crucial in pre-earthquake planning, and post-earthquake response of transportation systems. Such assessments provide valuable knowledge about a number of principal effects of earthquakes such as traffic disruption of the overall highway system, impact on the regions' economy and post-earthquake response and recovery, and more recently serve as measures to quantify resilience. Unlike previous work, this study captures unique bridge design attributes specific to California bridge classes along with their evolution over three significant design eras, separated by the historic 1971 San Fernando and 1989 Loma Prieta earthquakes (these events affected changes in bridge seismic design philosophy). This research developed next-generation fragility curves for four multispan concrete bridge classes by synthesizing new knowledge and emerging modeling capabilities, and by closely coordinating new and ongoing national research initiatives with expertise from bridge designers. 
A multi-phase framework was developed for generating fragility curves, which provides decision makers with essential tools for emergency response, design, planning, policy support, and maximizing investments in bridge retrofit. This framework encompasses generational changes in bridge design and construction details. Parameterized high-fidelity three-dimensional nonlinear analytical models are developed for the portfolios of bridge classes within different design eras. These models incorporate a wide range of geometric and material uncertainties, and their responses are characterized under seismic loadings. Fragility curves were then developed considering the vulnerability of multiple components and thereby help to quantify the performance of highway bridge networks and to study the impact of seismic design principles on the performance within a bridge class. This not only leads to the development of fragility relations that are unique and better suited for bridges in California, but also leads to the creation of better bridge classes and sub-bins that have more consistent performance characteristics than those currently provided by the National Bridge Inventory. Another important feature of this research is associated with the development of damage state definitions and grouping of bridge components in a way that they have similar consequences in terms of repair and traffic implications following a seismic event. These definitions are in alignment with the California Department of Transportation's design and operational experience, thereby enabling better performance assessment, emergency response, and management in the aftermath of a seismic event. The fragility curves developed as a part of this research will be employed in {ShakeCast}, a web-based post-earthquake situational awareness application that automatically retrieves earthquake shaking data and generates potential damage assessment notifications for emergency managers and responders.},

This paper presents a model to evaluate such performance indicators. The model integrates multiple infrastructural systems within a consistent computational framework where the consequences of their physical damage and interactions are used in the quantitative assessment of social losses. In particular, the interaction between the physical damage state of buildings and the combined residual service level in the utility networks is used to assess the habitability of buildings from which the number of displaced persons can be computed. The model is integrated within a larger analysis framework for the seismic vulnerability assessment of interconnected infrastructural systems, accounting for relevant uncertainties and interdependencies. A simple application illustrates the model capabilities. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The methodology draws upon the urban metabolism and sustainability indicators approaches to assessing urban sustainability, but compares modes in terms of passenger-kms. In assessing the economic sustainability of a city, transportation should be recognized as a product, a driver and a cost. In 1993, the traded costs of automobile use in the {GTA} were approximately balanced by the value of the automobile parts and assembly industry. But local transit costs 1/3 to 1/6 of the auto costs per person-km, in traded dollars, mainly because local labour is the primary {cost.Public} transportation is more sustainable from an environmental perspective. Automobile emissions are a major contributor to air pollution, which is a serious contemporary environmental health problem in Toronto. Public transportation modes are less energy intensive (including indirect energy consumption) and produce {CO2} at an order of magnitude lower, although these benefits are partially undermined by under-utilization of transit capacity and the source of electricity {generation.The} social benefits of automobile use are likely more significant than costs in determining {GTA} residents' preferential mode choice. The speed and access of auto use provide important economic benefits, e.g. relating to employment and product choice. Nevertheless, offsetting the service attributes of private transportation are large social costs in terms of accidents. The costs of automobile insurance provide one tangible measure of such negative {impacts.In} order to improve the sustainability of the {GTA}, innovative approaches are required for improving the performance level of public transportation or substantially reducing the need for the service level provided by automobiles. Efforts such as greater integration of bicycles with public transit, or construction of light-rail systems in wide roadways, might be considered. But to be sustainable overall, a transportation system has to be flexible and adaptable and so must combine a mixture of modes.},

We compute numerous features of the graph including the number of users and friendships, the degree distribution, path lengths, clustering, and mixing patterns. Our results center around three main observations. First, we characterize the global structure of the graph, determining that the social network is nearly fully connected, with 99.91\% of individuals belonging to a single large connected component, and we confirm the "six degrees of separation" phenomenon on a global scale. Second, by studying the average local clustering coefficient and degeneracy of graph neighborhoods, we show that while the Facebook graph as a whole is clearly sparse, the graph neighborhoods of users contain surprisingly dense structure. Third, we characterize the assortativity patterns present in the graph by studying the basic demographic and network properties of users. We observe clear degree assortativity and characterize the extent to which "your friends have more friends than you". Furthermore, we observe a strong effect of age on friendship preferences as well as a globally modular community structure driven by nationality, but we do not find any strong gender homophily. We compare our results with those from smaller social networks and find mostly, but not entirely, agreement on common structural network characteristics.},

This research presents a methodology to estimate bridge fragilities using spatially interpolated and updated deterioration parameters from a limited set of instrumented bridges in the network, while incorporating the impacts of overlooked correlation factors in bridge fragility estimates. Simulated samples of correlated bridge failures are used in an enhanced Monte Carlo method to assess bridge network reliability, and the impact of different correlation structures on the network reliability is discussed.

	abstract = {Abstract Analysis of the seismic risk to a structure requires assessment of both the rate of occurrence of future earthquake ground motions (hazard) and the effect of these ground motions on the structure (response). These two pieces are often linked using an intensity measure such as spectral acceleration. However, earth scientists typically use the geometric mean of the spectral accelerations of the two horizontal components of ground motion as the intensity measure for hazard analysis, while structural engineers often use spectral acceleration of a single horizontal component as the intensity measure for response analysis. This inconsistency in definitions is typically not recognized when the two assessments are combined, resulting in unconservative conclusions about the seismic risk to the structure. The source and impact of the problem is examined in this paper, and several potential resolutions are proposed. This discussion is directly applicable to probabilistic analyses, but also has implications for deterministic seismic evaluations.},

This paper provides a methodology and a set of indicators for measuring baseline characteristics of communities that foster resilience.  By establishing baseline conditions, it becomes possible to monitor changes in resilience over time in particular places and to compare one place to another.  We apply our methodology to counties within the Southeastern United States as a proof of concept.  The results show that spatial variations in disaster resilience exist and are especially evident in the rural/urban divide, where metropolitan areas have higher levels of resilience than rural counties.  However, the individual drivers of the disaster resilience (or lack thereof)—social, economic, institutional, infrastructure, and community capacities—vary widely.},

	abstract = {Assessment of seismic hazard using conventional probabilistic seismic hazard analysis ({PSHA)} typically involves the assumption that the logarithmic spectral acceleration values follow a normal distribution marginally. There are, however, a variety of cases in which a vector of ground-motion intensity measures are considered for seismic hazard analysis. In such cases, assumptions regarding the joint distribution of the ground-motion intensity measures are required for analysis. In this article, statistical tests are used to examine the assumption of univariate normality of logarithmic spectral acceleration values and to verify that vectors of logarithmic spectral acceleration values computed at different sites and/or different periods follow a multivariate normal distribution. Multivariate normality of logarithmic spectral accelerations are verified by testing the multivariate normality of interevent and intraevent residuals obtained from ground-motion models.
The univariate normality tests indicate that both interevent and intraevent residuals can be well represented by normal distributions marginally. No evidence is found to support truncation of the normal distribution, as is sometimes done in {PSHA.} The tests for multivariate normality show that interevent and intraevent residuals at a site, computed at different periods, follow multivariate normal distributions. It is also seen that spatially distributed intraevent residuals can be well represented by the multivariate normal distribution. This study provides a sound statistical basis for assumptions regarding the marginal and joint distribution of ground-motion parameters that must be made for a variety of seismic hazard calculations.},

The objective of this chapter is to propose appropriate fragility functions for roadway and railway components other than bridges that are presented separately in Chap. 9. To this end, the main typological features are summarized and a short review of earthquake damages together with damage states definitions are provided for these elements. Fragility curves from literature are collected and reviewed. In some cases these functions are modified and adapted, while in other cases new fragility curves are developed. A general procedure for the derivation of analytical fragility curves that was followed in {SYNER-G} is described. This approach takes into account the effect of structure geometry, ground motion characteristics, soil conditions and associated uncertainties. New fragility curves are presented for tunnels in soil, embankments, cuttings and bridge abutments based on numerical analyses due to ground shaking. Finally, the proposed fragility functions are summarized and a general scheme to identify the functionality of roadway and railway elements due to different damage levels is outlined.},

We present the overall results obtained from multiple sources of information, primarily from an integrated database containing all the data gathered. The results that describe the inflicted damage, costs of repair and other variables are presented both statistically and geographically. This information was valuable for the construction of an overall earthquake impact based on the systemic analysis of the urban area through the identification of criteria and definition of descriptors leading to a disruption index. The paper is developed as follows. First, we introduce the descriptions of the earthquake effects on the broader set of existing urban systems.

	abstract = {The Northridge earthquake of 17 January 1994, killed 57 people and injured an estimated 10,000 persons. The earthquake is the most costly disaster in {U.S.} history, in terms of dollar loss; costs continue to rise as more damage is uncovered, repairs are made, and disaster-related claims are paid out. Recently-issued government estimates place the losses due to direct earthquake damage at approximately \$25 billion (Governor's Office of Emergency Services and Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1996), and researchers who are tracking Northridge-related losses believe �it is quite possible that total losses, excluding indirect effects, could reach as much as \$40 billion� (Eguchi, et al, 1996) The number of households and businesses that were affected by the earthquake far exceeded the size of the victim population in other recent major disasters in the {U.S.}, including Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and the assistance effort that was launched was the largest ever undertaken for a {U.S.} disaster. By the end of 1995, 681,710 applications for state and federal assistance had been received, which was more than double the amount filed for any other single disaster event (Governer's Office of Emergency Services and Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1996). Applications for the housing assistance programs operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency totalled well over half a million, and nearly 200,000 households applied to the {U.S.} Small Business Administration ({SBA)} for loans to rebuild or repair their homes. Additionally, approximately 39,000 businesses applied to the Small Business Administration for disaster loans ({EQE} International, 1995). This paper focuses on the immediate and longer-term impacts the earthquake had on businesses in the Greater Los Angeles region. The data reported here are based on a survey that the Disaster Research Center, at the University of Delaware, conducted with a representative, randomly-selected sample of businesses in the cities of Los Angeles and Santa Monica, two jurisdictions that were particularly hard-hit by the earthquake. The material presented here is primarily descriptive. The goal of this paper is not to develop or test complex analytic models, although the paper does refer to other more quantitative analyses that have been performed on these data. Rather, the objective is to outline for readers empirical findings on the various ways that the earthquake affected the operations and viability of businesses on the impact area. Few studies exist that document the range of impacts that disasters can have on businesses and business sectors, and even fewer are based on detailed data from large representative samples. The paper addresses the following research questions: (1) What direct impacts and losses did businesses experience in the earthquake? (2) In what ways did the earthquake affect the operations of the businesses studied? If they experienced business interruption, why were they forced to close? What other kinds of problems did business have to cope with following the earthquake? (3) What earthquake preparedness measures had businesses undertaken prior to the disaster, and what have they done subsequently to prepare? and (4) To what extent have business operations returned to pre-earthquake levels, and which businesses appear to be experiencing the most difficulty with recovery?},

This study includes an inventory analysis of the approximately 375 bridges in the Charleston area, and convolution of the seismic hazard with fragility curves analytically derived for classes of bridges common to this part of the country. State-of-the-art bridge fragility curves and replacement cost estimates based on region-specific data are used to obtain economic loss estimates. The distribution of potential bridge damage and economic losses are evaluated for several scenario events in order to aid in the identification of emergency routes and assess areas for investment in retrofit. This article also evaluates the effect of uncertainty on the resulting predicted economic losses. The findings reveal that while the risk assessment is very sensitive to both the assumed fragility curves and damage ratios, the estimate of total expected economic losses is more sensitive to the vast differences in damage ratio models considered.},

	abstract = {When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.},

Using an eight-stage typology to organise the findings, this literature review presents the results from a wide range of studies. The synthesis shows how various racial and ethnic groups perceive natural hazard risks and respond to warnings, how groups may be differentially affected, both physically and psychologically, and how disaster effects vary by race and ethnicity during the periods of emergency response, recovery and reconstruction. We show that studies have important findings, many illustrating that racial and ethnic communities in the {US} are more vulnerable to natural disasters, due to factors such as language, housing patterns, building construction, community isolation and cultural insensitivities. By presenting these studies together, we are able to witness patterns of racial and ethnic inequalities that may be more difficult to see or interpret in individual studies that take place in one specific time and place. We conclude the review with policy and research recommendations.},

This paper investigates whether certain characteristics of the built environment are associated with obesity or coronary heart disease ({CHD)} risk among uninsured low-income women.
Using a sample of 2001-2002 data from 2692 women enrolled in the {WISEWOMAN} program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the study team performed regression analysis (conducted in {January-April} 2005) to estimate body mass index ({BMI)} and the log of 10-year {CHD} risk as a function of the built environment and socioecologic measures.
For women living in an environment of maximum mixed land use (i.e., an environment more conducive to healthy living), {BMI} was lower by 2.60 kg/m2 and {CHD} risk was lower by 20\% than for women living in single-use uniform environments (i.e., environments less conducive to healthy living). An additional fitness facility per 1000 residents was associated with {BMI} and {CHD} risk that were lower by 1.39 kg/m2 and 15.1\%, respectively. Crime was positively associated with {BMI} and {CHD} risk, whereas neighborhood affluence was negatively associated. Living in more racially segregated areas was negatively associated with {CHD} risk among black, Hispanic, and Asian women and positively associated with {CHD} risk among American Indian women.
The built environment and socioecologic characteristics of financially disadvantaged women were associated with {BMI} and {CHD} risk. More research is needed to understand the effects of racial segregation or acculturation on health for specific subpopulations.},

To simplify mapmaking process, vehicles could use their computational resources to directly generate accurate map data. We envisage vehicles on the road network forming a wide-scale mobile sensing and computing platform. Toward that goal, we've developed an algorithm for keeping digital maps up-to-date, using ordinary vehicles making normal journeys rather than fleets of dedicated probe vehicles.

	abstract = {The January 17, 1994 Northridge Earthquake damaged four major freeways in the Los Angeles area, creating the prospect of gridlock in the nation's prototypical automobile city. This paper examines the effect of the transportation damage on business activity. Using survey responses from 559 firms in the Los Angeles area, this paper gives information on the extent and magnitude of the business losses that can be attributed to the transportation disruptions. Despite the fact that the freeway damage was repaired exceptionally quickly, 43\% of the firms that reported any earthquake loss stated that some portion of that loss was due to transportation damage. For the firms that attributed some loss to transportation damage, the average response was that 39\% of their earthquake-related business losses were due to the disruptions in the transportation system. Comparing information on these and other survey responses yields several policy recommendations, which are summarized at the end of the paper.},

	abstract = {We investigated how patients were evacuated and transported from affected hospitals in the disaster area to backup hospitals following the 1995 catastrophic Hanshin-Awaji earthquake. A retrospective review was conducted of medical records of 6107 patients hospitalized during the first 15 days after the earthquake, collected from 48 affected hospitals in the disaster area and 47 backup hospitals in the surrounding area. Of the 6107 patients, a total of 2290 (38\%) were transferred to backup hospitals, consisting of 187 patients (50\%) with crush syndrome, 702 (26\%) with other traumas, and 1401 (41\%) with illness. Of those 2290 patients, 1741 (76\%) were transferred from affected hospitals to backup hospitals, while 549 patients (24\%) were evacuated directly to backup hospitals. The peak in transport came during the first 4 days. The family car was the most frequently used means of transport; ambulance was used in only 26\% of cases, and helicopters were used minimally. There was no notable difference in the percentage of intensive care patients and nonintensive care patients transferred to backup hospitals. The mortality rate for patients with trauma and crush syndrome was significantly higher in the affected hospitals. These results suggest that the existing emergency medical service system was not adequate for this urban earthquake. From our vantage point, we are keenly aware of the need for improved communications between hospitals, a well equipped patient transport system, and a well coordinated disaster response mechanism.},

	abstract = {Catastrophe Modeling: A New Approach to Managing Risk is the first book that systematically analyzes how catastrophe models can be used for assessing and managing risks of extreme events. It focuses on natural disaster risk, but also discusses the management of terrorism risk. A unique feature of this book is the involvement of three leading catastrophe modeling firms, {AIR} Worldwide, {EQECAT}, and Risk Management Solutions, who examine the role of catastrophe modeling in rate setting, portfolio management and risk financing. Using data from three model cities (Oakland, {CA}, Long Beach, {CA} and {Miami/Dade} County, {FLA)}, experts from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania examine the role of catastrophe modeling to develop risk management strategies for reducing and spreading the losses from future disasters. Given the uncertainties associated with terrorism the book points out the opportunities for utilizing catastrophe models to set insurance rates and to examine public-private partnerships for providing financial assistance in the event of a terrorist attack.   {"This} book fills a critical need in setting forth the role of modern risk analysis in managing catastrophe risk. There is no comparable reference work for this important subject area. The book is well written and well organized. It contains contributions from many of the most distinguished experts in the fields of risk analysis and risk management. It strikes a good balance between the technical aspects of the subject and the practical aspects of decision making." {"This} book is strongly recommended for individuals who must make decisions regarding the management of impacts of catastrophe risks including those in both the public and private sector."

The relevant limit state criterion is pointwise approximated by a tangent hyperplane. The combination of time-variant actions then reduces to the calculation of the maximum of a sum of random variables which is facilitated through proper, discrete approximation of extreme value and other non-normal distribution functions by normal distributions. The iteration algorithm searches for an approximation point on the limit state criterion where the probability content of the failure domain limited by the tangent hyperplane reaches its maximum. Any type of continuous limit state criterion and any distribution type for the loads can be dealt with. The method is illustrated for a section of a wall without tensile strength loaded by a bending moment and a normal force.},

It simulates the local relevance decision-making for every location of a document, and combines all of these “local” relevance decisions as the “document-wide” relevance decision for the document. The significance of interpreting {TF-IDF} in this way is the potential to: (1) establish a unifying perspective about information retrieval as relevance decision-making; and (2) develop advanced {TF-IDF-related} term weights for future elaborate retrieval models. Our novel retrieval model is simplified to a basic ranking formula that directly corresponds to the {TF-IDF} term weights. In general, we show that the term-frequency factor of the ranking formula can be rendered into different term-frequency factors of existing retrieval systems. In the basic ranking formula, the remaining quantity - log p(\&rmacr;{\textbar}t ∈ d) is interpreted as the probability of randomly picking a nonrelevant usage (denoted by \&rmacr;) of term t. Mathematically, we show that this quantity can be approximated by the inverse document-frequency ({IDF).} Empirically, we show that this quantity is related to {IDF}, using four reference {TREC} ad hoc retrieval data collections.},

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/

To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine — the first such detailed public description we know of to date.

Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

	abstract = {In many parts of the world, earthquakes threaten regional infrastructure systems. For modeling risk using stochastic earthquake catalogs, random variables include rupture location and the damage state of different components. Thus, there is an infinite set of possible damage maps that a risk modeler could evaluate in an event-based probabilistic loss model. Even a finite but large number of damage maps may not be practical, because many network performance measures are computationally expensive. Here, we show a computationally efficient method for selecting a subset of damage maps, corresponding ground-motion intensity maps, and associated occurrence rates that reasonably estimates the full distribution of the ground-motion intensity and a target performance measure using optimization. The method chooses a subset of maps and associated annual rates of occurrence that minimizes the error in estimating the distribution of a network performance measure as well as the marginal distributions of ground-motion intensity exceedance. The joint distribution of the ground-motion intensity is implicitly included in the objective function of the optimization problem via the network performance measure. We then show how to tune the optimization parameters based on consistency checks related to the network performance measure and the ground-motion hazard. We illustrate the proposed method with a case study of the San Francisco Bay Area road network to estimate the exceedance curve of the average percentage change in morning commute trip time. This work facilitates expanded and risk-consistent studies of the impacts of infrastructure networks on regional seismic risk and resiliency. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Such failures progressively degrade the power network performance, potentially leading to a network blackout. Hence, in this paper, these components are incorporated into the network systems analysis taking their seismic vulnerability into consideration in the form of fragility curves for the evaluation of the network performance under seismic conditions. Specifically, most critical to the operation of transmission network, transformers, disconnect switches, circuit breakers and buses are integrated into the systems analysis, exploring the possibility of progressive failures of these components. The scenarios of these component failures can make it possible to estimate quantitatively direct cost of damage, emergency repair and restoration, and duration of power interruption and attendant economic losses and societal disruption.

For calibration, we use global 30 arc sec topographic data and {VS30} measurements (here {VS30} refers to the average shear-velocity down to 30 m) aggregated from several studies in the United States, as well as in Taiwan, Italy, and Australia. {VS30} values are correlated against topographic slope to develop two sets of parameters for deriving {VS30:} one for active tectonic regions where topographic relief is high, and one for stable shields where topography is more subdued. By taking the gradient of the topography and choosing ranges of slope that maximize the correlation with shallow shear-velocity observations, we can recover, to first order, many of the spatially varying features of site-condition maps developed for California. Our site-condition map for the low-relief Mississippi Embayment also predicts the bulk of the {VS30} observations in that region despite rather low slope ranges.
We find that maps derived from the slope of the topography are often well correlated with other independently derived, regional-scale site-condition maps, but the latter maps vary in quality and continuity, and subsequently, also in their ability to match observed {VS30} measurements contained therein. Alternatively, the slope-based method provides a simple approach to uniform site-condition mapping.
After validating this approach in regions with numerous {VS30} observations, we subsequently estimate and map site conditions for the entire continental United States using the respective slope correlations.},

	abstract = {Two key issues distinguish probabilistic seismic risk analysis of a lifeline or portfolio of structures from that of a single structure. Regional analysis must consider the correlation among lifeline components or structures in the portfolio, and the larger scope makes it much more computationally demanding. In this paper, we systematically identify and compare alternative methods for regional hazard analysis that can be used as the first part of a computationally efficient regional probabilistic seismic risk analysis that properly considers spatial correlation. Specifically, each method results in a set of probabilistic ground motion maps with associated hazard-consistent annual occurrence probabilities that together represent the regional hazard. The methods are compared according to how replicable and computationally tractable they are and the extent to which the resulting maps are physically realistic, consistent with the regional hazard and regional spatial correlation, and few in number. On the basis of a conceptual comparison and an empirical comparison for Los Angeles, we recommend a combination of simulation and optimization approaches: (i) Monte Carlo simulation with importance sampling of the earthquake magnitudes to generate a set of probabilistic earthquake scenarios (defined by source and magnitude); (ii) the optimization-based probabilistic scenario method, a mixed-integer linear program, to reduce the size of that set; (iii) Monte Carlo simulation to generate a set of probabilistic ground motion maps, varying the number of maps sampled from each earthquake scenario so as to minimize the sampling variance; and (iv) the optimization-based probabilistic scenario again to reduce the set of probabilistic ground motion maps.

	abstract = {The {U.S.} Geological Survey ({USGS)} is investigating how the social networking site Twitter, a popular service for sending and receiving short, public text messages, can augment {USGS} earthquake response products and the delivery of hazard information. Rapid detection and qualitative assessment of shaking events are possible because people begin sending public Twitter messages (tweets) with in tens of seconds after feeling shaking. Here we present and evaluate an earthquake detection procedure that relies solely on Twitter data. A tweet-frequency time series constructed from tweets containing the word “earthquake” clearly shows large peaks correlated with the origin times of widely felt events. To identify possible earthquakes, we use a short-term-average, long-term-average algorithm. When tuned to a moderate sensitivity, the detector finds 48 globally-distributed earthquakes with only two false triggers in five months of data. The number of detections is small compared to the 5,175 earthquakes in the {USGS} global earthquake catalog for the same five-month time period, and no accurate location or magnitude can be assigned based on tweet data alone. However, Twitter earthquake detections are not without merit. The detections are generally caused by widely felt events that are of more immediate interest than those with no human impact. The detections are also fast; about 75\% occur within two minutes of the origin time. This is considerably faster than seismographic detections in poorly instrumented regions of the world. The tweets triggering the detections also provided very short first-impression narratives from people who experienced the shaking.},

The minimization problems of the potential energy and the complementary energy for incremental analysis are then formulated as the primal-dual pair of {SOCP} problems, which can be solved with a primal-dual interior-point method. To enhance numerical performance of tracing an equilibrium path, we propose a warm-start strategy for a primal-dual interior-point method based on the primal-dual penalty method. In this warm-start strategy, we solve a penalized {SOCP} problem to find the equilibrium solution at the current loading step. An advanced initial point for solving this penalized {SOCP} problem is defined by using information of the solution at the previous loading step.},

This paper addresses the modeling of temperature effects on modal frequencies for the cable-stayed Ting Kau Bridge (Hong Kong), which has been instrumented with a long-term structural health monitoring system. Based on one-year measurement data obtained from 45 accelerometers and 83 temperature sensors permanently installed on the bridge, modal frequencies of the first ten modes and temperatures at different locations of the bridge are obtained at one-hour intervals. Then the support vector machine ({SVM)} technique is applied to formulate regression models which quantify the effect of temperature on modal frequencies. In order to achieve a trade-off between simulation performance and generalization, the measurement data is separated into two subsets for the model development: one for training the models, and the other for validating the models. A squared correlation coefficient is defined for optimizing the {SVM} coefficients to obtain good generalization performance. The results obtained by the {SVM} models are compared with those produced by a multivariate linear regression model, and show that the {SVM} models exhibit good capabilities for mapping between the temperature and modal frequencies.},

Most data in earlier research were auditor data; Later research establish model by using sharing data and public statement data. Company governance data have been widely used. It is generally believed that ratio data is more effective than accounting data; Seldom research on time Series Data Mining were conducted. The retrieved literature used mining algorithms including statistical test, regression analysis, neural networks, decision tree, Bayesian network, and stack variables etc.. Regression Analysis is widely used on hiding data. Generally the detecting effect and accuracy of {NN} are superior to regression model. General conclusion is that model detecting is better than auditor detecting rate without assisting. There is a need to introduce other algorithms of no-tag data mining. Owing to the small size of fraud samples, some literature reached conclusion based on training samples and may overestimated the effect of model.},

Our models are built on an understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of the expected state of traffic at different times of day and locations and past incidents. With high accuracy, our model can predict false reports of incidents that are made to the highway patrol and classify the duration of the incident-induced delays and the magnitude of the incident impact, measured as a function of vehicles delayed, the spatial and temporal extent of the incident. Equipped with our predictions of traffic incident costs and relative impacts, highway operators and first responders will be able to more effectively respond to reports of highway incidents, ultimately improving drivers' welfare and reducing urban congestion.},

These include special single purpose government entities that may not provide essential health and safety services of a governmental nature, whose eligibility is determined by the state.  This study was limited to identifying the populations served by these local plans.  As of mid-August 2005, 51 of the 58 state entities had local plans.  This documentation review revealed there were only 1139 of the congressionally mandated local approved plans with 5793 participating jurisdictions representing only 37.44\% of the nation's population.  Ten state entities' local approved plans covered 69\% or greater of the state's population and only five out of that ten were able to achieve of 88\% or greater.  The lower quartile's performance pre-Katrina and post-Katrina is examined. The low adoption rate, whether caused by multiple philosophies, misinterpretations or limited local capacity, capability, competence or support, must be determined by more in-depth research.  However, it was noted that the Pre-Disaster Mitigation ({PDM)} program guidance was more focused on pre-disaster mitigation strategies and competitive cost-effective projects then all-hazards risk and vulnerability assessments.  To determine if a local or state {PDM} project will be cost-effective and maximize the benefits to the Nation, these assessments must be completed first for all local counties and all hazards.},

	abstract = {The internal complexity of lifeline systems and their standing interdependencies can operate in conjunction to amplify the negative effects of external disruptions. This paper introduces a simulation-based methodology to evaluate the joint impact of interdependence, component fragilities, and cascading failures in systemic fragility estimates. The proposed strategy uses a graph model of interdependent networks, an enhanced betweenness centrality for cascading failures approximation, and an interdependence model accounting for coupling uncertainty in the simulation of damage propagation for probabilistic performance assessment. This methodology is illustrated through its application to a realistic set of power and water networks subjected to earthquake scenarios and random failures. Test case results reveal two key insights: (1) the intensity of a perturbation influences interdependent systemic fragility by shaping the magnitudes of initial component damage and, sometimes counter-intuitively, the subsequent interdependence effects and (2) increasing local redundancy mitigates the effects of interdependence on systemic performance, but such intervention is incapable of eliminating interdependent effects completely. The previous insights provide basic guidelines for the design of systemic retrofitting policies. Additionally, the limitations of local capacity redundancy as a fragility control measure highlight the need for a critical assessment of intervention strategies in distributed infrastructure networks. Future work will assess the fragility-reduction efficiency of strategies involving informed manipulation of individual systemic topologies and the interdependence interfaces connecting them.},

Citizens advisory groups are needed to provide early guidance for this technical activity and to appreciate the uncertainties associated with the data and methods. Transportation analysis procedures to analyze changes in accessibility between alternatives in the long-range regional transportation plan are outlined. These methods map out changes in accessibility to evaluate impacts on transportation disadvantaged versus nondisadvantaged neighborhoods.

	abstract = {The 2007 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities ({WGCEP}, 2007) presents the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 2 ({UCERF} 2). This model comprises a time-independent (Poisson-process) earthquake rate model, developed jointly with the National Seismic Hazard Mapping Program and a time-dependent earthquake-probability model, based on recent earthquake rates and stress-renewal statistics conditioned on the date of last event. The models were developed from updated statewide earthquake catalogs and fault deformation databases using a uniform methodology across all regions and implemented in the modular, extensible Open Seismic Hazard Analysis framework. The rate model satisfies integrating measures of deformation across the plate-boundary zone and is consistent with historical seismicity data. An overprediction of earthquake rates found at intermediate magnitudes ({6.5≤M≤7.0)} in previous models has been reduced to within the 95\% confidence bounds of the historical earthquake catalog. A logic tree with 480 branches represents the epistemic uncertainties of the full time-dependent model. The mean {UCERF} 2 time-dependent probability of one or more M≥6.7 earthquakes in the California region during the next 30 yr is 99.7\%; this probability decreases to 46\% for M≥7.5 and to 4.5\% for M≥8.0. These probabilities do not include the Cascadia subduction zone, largely north of California, for which the estimated 30 yr, M≥8.0 time-dependent probability is 10\%. The M≥6.7 probabilities on major strike-slip faults are consistent with the {WGCEP} (2003) study in the San Francisco Bay Area and the {WGCEP} (1995) study in southern California, except for significantly lower estimates along the San Jacinto and Elsinore faults, owing to provisions for larger multisegment ruptures. Important model limitations are discussed.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic seismic risk assessment for spatially distributed lifelines is less straightforward than for individual structures. While procedures such as the {‘PEER} framework’ have been developed for risk assessment of individual structures, these are not easily applicable to distributed lifeline systems, due to difficulties in describing ground-motion intensity (e.g. spectral acceleration) over a region (in contrast to ground-motion intensity at a single site, which is easily quantified using Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis), and since the link between the ground-motion intensities and lifeline performance is usually not available in closed form. As a result, Monte Carlo simulation ({MCS)} and its variants are well suited for characterizing ground motions and computing resulting losses to lifelines. This paper proposes a simulation-based framework for developing a small but stochastically representative catalog of earthquake ground-motion intensity maps that can be used for lifeline risk assessment. In this framework, Importance Sampling is used to preferentially sample ‘important’ ground-motion intensity maps, and K-Means Clustering is used to identify and combine redundant maps in order to obtain a small catalog. The effects of sampling and clustering are accounted for through a weighting on each remaining map, so that the resulting catalog is still a probabilistically correct representation. The feasibility of the proposed simulation framework is illustrated by using it to assess the seismic risk of a simplified model of the San Francisco Bay Area transportation network. A catalog of just 150 intensity maps is generated to represent hazard at 1038 sites from 10 regional fault segments causing earthquakes with magnitudes between five and eight. The risk estimates obtained using these maps are consistent with those obtained using conventional {MCS} utilizing many orders of magnitudes more ground-motion intensity maps. Therefore, the proposed technique can be used to drastically reduce the computational expense of a simulation-based risk assessment, without compromising the accuracy of the risk estimates. This will facilitate computationally intensive risk analysis of systems such as transportation networks. Finally, the study shows that the uncertainties in the ground-motion intensities and the spatial correlations between ground-motion intensities at various sites must be modeled in order to obtain unbiased estimates of lifeline risk.

	shorttitle = {San Andreas Fault Zone, California},
	doi = {10.1785/0120000614},
	abstract = {The San Andreas fault zone has been a very significant source of major California earthquakes. From 1812 to 1906 it generated four major earthquakes of M ∼7 or larger in two pairs on two major portions of the fault. A pair of major earthquakes occurred on the central to southern region, where the 1857 faulting overlapped the 1812 earthquake faulting. A pair of major earthquakes occurred on the northern region, where the 1906 faulting overlapped the 1838 earthquake faulting. Also, earthquakes of M ∼7 occurred in the San Francisco Bay area on the Hayward fault in 1868 and the Santa Cruz Mountains near Loma Prieta in 1989 and on the Imperial fault near the border with Mexico in 1940.
The 1838 earthquake's damage effects throughout the Bay area, from San Francisco to Santa Clara Valley and Monterey, were unequalled by any historical earthquake other than the 1906 event. This, and numerous strong possible aftershocks during the following 3 years in the San Juan Bautista vicinity, suggest 1838 faulting from San Francisco to San Juan Bautista.
Cycles of seismicity and quiescence were associated with the Bay area earthquakes of 1868, 1906, and 1989. The 1868 earthquake on the Hayward fault was preceded by 12 earthquakes of M ≥5.5 from 1855 to 1866, within 60 km of the Hayward fault, and was followed by 13 quiet years. The 1906 San Andreas fault event was preceded from 1881 to 1903 by 18 earthquakes of M ≥5.5 and was followed by quiescence, with only three earthquakes of M ≥5.5 until 1954. The Bay area has been seismically quiet at the M ≥5.5 level since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and its 1990 aftershocks, which contrasts with the 10 years before 1989, when five M 5.5-6.2 events occurred. The Loma Prieta earthquake is of similar magnitude to the 1868 Hayward event and could be followed by a similarly short quiet period.
The 1857 earthquake had immediate foreshocks in the {Lonoak-Bitterwater} region ∼50 km northwest of Parkfield. In the northern end zone of the 1857 rupture, extending southeast from Bitterwater ∼70 km to Parkfield, the rate of seismic moment release has decreased with time since 1857. This may reflect the decay with time of the stress loading due to the ∼9 m 1857 fault displacements ∼80 km southeast of Parkfield and explain why the predicted earthquake, which was based on the assumption of regular recurrence of Parkfield earthquakes, has not yet occurred.
The extent of the 1812 earthquake fault rupture is not well defined. Jacoby et al. (1988) estimated that it extended ∼170 km from Cajon Pass to Tejon Pass. Based on this estimate, we present the hypothesis that the rupture occurred in two segments in December 1812. The eastern segment generated the 8 December earthquake that damaged San Juan Capistrano, San Gabriel, San Fernando, and San Buenaventura. Thirteen days later the western segment ruptured generating the earthquake that damaged San Fernando and San Buenaventura again, as well as Santa Barbara, Santa Ynez, and Purisima Concepcion.},

	abstract = {Large tropical cyclones cause severe damage to major cities along the United States Gulf Coast annually. A diverse collection of engineering and statistical models are currently used to estimate the geographical distribution of power outage probabilities stemming from these hurricanes to aid in storm preparedness and recovery efforts. Graph theoretic studies of power networks have separately attempted to link abstract network topology to transmission and distribution system reliability. However, few works have employed both techniques to unravel the intimate connection between network damage arising from storms, topology, and system reliability. This investigation presents a new methodology combining hurricane damage predictions and topological assessment to characterize the impact of hurricanes upon power system reliability. Component fragility models are applied to predict failure probability for individual transmission and distribution power network elements simultaneously. The damage model is calibrated using power network component failure data for Harris County, {TX}, {USA} caused by Hurricane Ike in September of 2008, resulting in a mean outage prediction error of 15.59\% and low standard deviation. Simulated hurricane events are then applied to measure the hurricane reliability of three topologically distinct transmission networks. The rate of system performance decline is shown to depend on their topological structure. Reliability is found to correlate directly with topological features, such as network meshedness, centrality, and clustering, and the compact irregular ring mesh topology is identified as particularly favorable, which can influence regional lifeline policy for retrofit and hardening activities to withstand hurricane events.},

This article presents a theoretical basis for predicting {ASI}, based on prediction equations for spectral acceleration, both for individual sites and spatially distributed regions. {ASI} is found to have a better predictability than conventional ground-motion {IMs} such as elastic pseudospectral acceleration at a specific period. Furthermore, for site-specific applications conditional response spectra are derived, which can be considered as the correct target response spectra for ground-motion selection, and the features of these conditional spectra as a function of earthquake magnitude, source-to-site distance, and epsilon are examined. For spatially distributed applications, the intraevent correlation of {ASI} as a function of the separation distance of two sites is derived and compared to that of other common {IMs.}},

Based on this finding we propose a network of road usage by defining a bipartite network framework, demonstrating that in contrast to traditional approaches, which define road importance solely by topological measures, the role of a road segment depends on both: its betweeness and its degree in the road usage network.

This paper shows how the conventional methods of applied welfare economics can be modified to handle such cases. It focuses on the computation of the excess burden of taxation, and the evaluation of quality change. The results are applied to stochastic utility models, including the popular cases of probit and logit analysis.

	abstract = {The prediction of possible future losses from earthquakes, which in many cases affect structures that are spatially distributed over a wide area, is of importance to national authorities, local governments, and the insurance and reinsurance industries. Generally, it is necessary to estimate the effects of many, or even all, potential earthquake scenarios that could impact upon these urban areas. In such cases, the purpose of the loss calculations is to estimate the annual frequency of exceedance (or the return period) of different levels of loss due to earthquakes: so-called loss exceedance curves. An attractive option for generating loss exceedance curves is to perform independent probabilistic seismic hazard assessment calculations at several locations simultaneously and to combine the losses at each site for each annual frequency of exceedance. An alternative method involves the use of multiple earthquake scenarios to generate ground motions at all sites of interest, defined through {Monte-Carlo} simulations based on the seismicity model. The latter procedure is conceptually sounder but considerably more time-consuming. Both procedures are applied to a case study loss model and the loss exceedance curves and average annual losses are compared to ascertain the influence of using a more theoretically robust, though computationally intensive, procedure to represent the seismic hazard in loss modelling.},

After reviewing the basic theory of {SOCPs}, we describe general families of problems that can be recast as {SOCPs.} These include robust linear programming and robust least-squares problems, problems involving sums or maxima of norms, or with convex hyperbolic constraints. We discuss a variety of engineering applications, such as filter design, antenna array weight design, truss design, and grasping force optimization in robotics. We describe an efficient primal-dual interior-point method for solving {SOCPs}, which shares many of the features of primal-dual interior-point methods for linear programming ({LP):} Worst-case theoretical analysis shows that the number of iterations required to solve a problem grows at most as the square root of the problem size, while numerical experiments indicate that the typical number of iterations ranges between 5 and 50, almost independent of the problem size.},

In this paper, we describe a heuristic, based on convex optimization, for approximately solving this problem. Our heuristic gives a subset selection as well as a bound on the best performance that can be achieved by any selection of k sensor measurements. There is no guarantee that the gap between the performance of the chosen subset and the performance bound is always small; but numerical experiments suggest that the gap is small in many cases.

The concepts of link importance and site exposure are introduced. In this paper, several link importance indices and site exposure indices are derived, based on the increase in generalised travel cost when links are closed. These measures are divided into two groups: one reflecting an “equal opportunities perspective”, and the other a “social efficiency perspective”. The measures are calculated for the road network of northern Sweden. Results are collected in a {GIS} for visualisation, and are presented per link and municipality. In view of the recent great interest in complex networks, some topological measures of the road network are also presented.},

Surges in fuel prices, political conflicts, wars and natural disasters threaten directly energy supply, and countries look at ways to protect themselves. On February 2010 an 8.8 Richter scale earthquake hit the central part of Chile and a tsunami following the earthquake hit coastal areas, affecting the most populated area of the country. Main supplies collapsed, electricity, water, gas, telephones, contributing to make matters worse for the suffering population. This paper illustrates events that took place in electricity supply during and after the earthquake in Chile, its impact on the generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, and the lessons to be learned. The challenges in reconstruction are also discussed. The main interconnected system, generation and main transmission grid, was able to resume partial operation within a few hours, although in a weak condition. Damage took place in some main substations, and alternative paths and operational conditions had to be found. Security criteria had to be degraded in the system operation and handling of the main grid. The Chilean codes impose strict anti seismic standards for all electricity infrastructure construction, but the earthquake strength still produced damage in some grid installations. However, the most severe damage took place in the distribution networks, vast areas were left with no supply for weeks, including the large city of Concepcion being severely affected.},

To apply relevance modeling to {TDT}, it had to be extended to work with stories rather than short queries, and the similarity comparison had to be changed to a modified form of Kullback-Leibler. We demonstrate that relevance models result in very substantial improvements over the language modeling baseline.

	abstract = {A novel approach and framework for the analysis of bridge networks is presented. The goal of the analysis is to assess the life-cycle performance of the network and its time-variant reliability. The proposed approach combines three important features that determine its ability to estimate with accuracy and robustness the reliability of a network along its life-cycle. The first one is that the reliability of the individual bridges is modeled as time-variant, due to the deterioration of their structural components. The network performance analysis is repeated for several time instants, with the relative reliability of the bridges. Therefore, the network performance indicators are also time-variant. In this way, the proposed procedure can be used as a basic tool for maintenance planning at the network level. The second asset is that the proposed framework takes into account complex (i.e. “generalized”) network layouts, not necessarily describable using series, parallel or series-parallel models. In fact, when all the possible traffic flows in a network and all the possible trip origins and destinations are considered, it is not feasible, in general, to model the network with a simple scheme. In the present paper, techniques derived from transportation engineering for the traffic flow distribution and assignment are used. The third feature is that the proposed approach considers a correlation structure among the states (in/out of service) of the various bridges of the network. In fact, bridges associated with the same network are likely to share similar characteristics and external loads. Therefore, a correlation structure for the service state of individual bridges is estimated and implemented in the analysis. A case study involving a transportation network with fourteen bridges is presented as a numerical application.},

After demographic characteristics were controlled for, the measures of accessibility, land use mixing, and land use balance—computed for trip-makers' home neighborhoods and at trip ends—proved to be highly statistically significant and influential in their impact on all measures of travel behavior. In many cases, balance, mix, and accessibility were found to be more relevant (as measured by elasticities) than several household and traveler characteristics that often form a basis for travel behavior prediction. In contrast, under all but the vehicle ownership models, the impact of density was negligible after accessibility was controlled.},

	abstract = {The flow capacity of a transportation network can be reduced significantly if its constituent bridges are damaged by natural or man-made hazards. For rapid risk-informed decision making on hazard mitigation and response, it is therefore essential to have a capability to predict the post-hazard flow capacity of the network efficiently and accurately. However, this is a challenging task due to the uncertainty in hazards and structural damage, and the complex nature of the network flow analysis. Moreover, the bridge structures may experience significant deterioration over their life cycle, which requires time-varying network reliability analysis. This paper proposes a new non-sampling-based approach to estimate the time-varying post-hazard flow capacity of a bridge transportation network considering structural deterioration of bridges. The proposed approach evaluates the probabilities of structural damage scenarios efficiently using the matrix-based system reliability method and rapidly computes the corresponding flow capacities using a maximum flow capacity analysis algorithm. The matrix-based framework facilitates the integration of these results to obtain the probabilistic distributions and statistical moments of the network flow capacity. It also enables computing various measures useful for risk-informed decision making, such as the conditional mean and standard deviation of flow capacity given observed structural damage, and component importance measures. In the proposed approach, probability calculation and network flow analysis are performed separately, which renders time-varying post-hazard flow capacity analysis efficient. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical example based on the Sioux Falls network under multiple bridge-deterioration scenarios simulating the progress of deterioration.},

An efficient algorithm based on finite-state Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations is also presented to assess the reliability of large ageing highway bridge networks without the need to simplify the network topology. The criticality of ageing bridges is then assessed through different proposed ranking strategies to arrive at an optimised seismic retrofit prioritisation. A case study on an existing bridge network with 515 bridges in the state of South Carolina, {USA} reveals striking differences between results of the proposed ranking strategies and those from state-of-the-practice methods. Such differences emphasise the significance of accounting for network-level importance in seismic retrofit programs of ageing transportation networks.},

Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial-temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.},

	abstract = {Risk assessment of spatially distributed building portfolios or infrastructure systems requires quantification of the joint occurrence of ground-motion intensities at several sites, during the same earthquake. The ground-motion models that are used for site-specific hazard analysis do not provide information on the spatial correlation between ground-motion intensities, which is required for the joint prediction of intensities at multiple sites. Moreover, researchers who have previously computed these correlations using observed ground-motion recordings differ in their estimates of spatial correlation. In this paper, ground motions observed during seven past earthquakes are used to estimate correlations between spatially distributed spectral accelerations at various spectral periods. Geostatistical tools are used to quantify and express the observed correlations in a standard format. The estimated correlation model is also compared with previously published results, and apparent discrepancies among the previous results are {explained.The} analysis shows that the spatial correlation reduces with increasing separation between the sites of interest. The rate of decay of correlation typically decreases with increasing spectral acceleration period. At periods longer than 2 s, the correlations were similar for all the earthquake ground motions considered. At shorter periods, however, the correlations were found to be related to the local-site conditions (as indicated by site Vs30 values) at the ground-motion recording stations. The research work also investigates the assumption of isotropy used in developing the spatial correlation models. It is seen using the Northridge and Chi-Chi earthquake time histories that the isotropy assumption is reasonable at both long and short periods. Based on the factors identified as influencing the spatial correlation, a model is developed that can be used to select appropriate correlation estimates for use in practical risk assessment problems.

	abstract = {During the last decade, critical infrastructure systems such as electric power, water distribution, transportation and telecommunications have been stressed by significant natural hazards and human errors leading to malfunction. Earthquakes, blackouts and satellite failures have evidenced the vulnerability of these growing networked systems threatening the continuity of the United States' economy. The potential for malicious perturbations to these systems is also an important current concern. However, the underlying susceptibility of these networks to disruptive events is in large part due to the increasingly complex pattern of interdependencies that tie these civil infrastructures together. This paper mainly investigates the effect of seismic disruptions on the performance of real interdependent networks. Maintenance-induced malfunctions and coordinated attacks are also studied for completeness. Several degrees of interconnectedness are explored. Interdependent network fragility curves are introduced to display the effect of these different strengths of coupling. Characterization of the performance displayed by the networks is utilized to propose mitigation actions and study propagation of their effects. It is shown that minimal strategic interventions propagated through the network can generate a more resilient interdependent entity. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Reliability based structural optimization requires a combined usage of numerical methods for structural reliability analysis and structural optimization. In analyses presented in the literature the approach has been to use nested analyses, where the structural reliability analysis is done within the structural optimization analysis. This means that the reliability and possibly also partial derivatives of the reliability are calculated each time the value of the objective function or constraints in the optimization are required. The reliability is typically calculated using a first- or second-order reliability method, while standard routines for non-linear optimization are used for the optimization part. Sensitivity factors, i.e. the sensitivity of the optimal solution for e.g. the structural dimensions to changes in cost or statistical input parameters, are computed by numerical differentiation. Another approach to reliability based optimization is to combine the numerical analysis for the reliability analysis with the numerical analysis in the optimization. In this paper a reliability analysis applying a first-order reliability method is combined with an optimization for minimization of total expected cost including the expected failure cost. The combined analysis is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem, where the reliability analysis in effect enters the cost optimization as an additional constraint. The combined optimization can then be solved by a standard solver, and sensitivity factors are a simple by-product of the analysis. The two approaches are described and are compared for two simple examples. The comparison is with respect to the number of times the limit state function is computed, as this is the part of the optimization which typically governs the total analysis time.},

A second purpose of the volume is to communicate results largely reported in the econometrics literature to a wider community of researchers to whom they are directly relevant, including applied econometricians, statisticians in the area of discrete multivariate analysis, specialists in biometrics, psychometrics, and sociometrics, and analysts in various applied fields such as finance, marketing, and transportation. The papers are grouped into four sections: Statistical Analysis of Discrete Probability Models,with papers by the editors and by Steven Cosslett; Dynamic Discrete Probability Models,consisting of two contributions by James Heckman; Structural Discrete Probability Models Derived from Theories of Choice,with papers by Daniel {McFadden}, Gregory Fischer and Daniel Nagin, Steven Lerman and Charles Manski, and Moshe Ben-Akiva and Thawat Watanatada; and Simultaneous Systems Models with Discrete Endogenous Variables,with contributions by Lung-Fei Lee, Jerry Hausman and David Wise, Dale Poirier, Peter Schmidt, and Robert Avery.

Because of their inter-connected nature, once one infrastructure system is damaged by an earthquake or other natural hazard, other infrastructure systems may malfunction as well. A number of previous studies have assessed vulnerability of infrastructure systems to earthquakes, but seldom have failures due to infrastructure system interactions been considered. In its assessment of the earthquake-induced damage of a municipal water system, this paper includes the impact of damage to the supporting electrical power system using a fault tree analysis and a shortest-path algorithm. The effect of uncertainty of seismic intensity and component fragility on network integrity is evaluated. A case study involving a simple model of the electrical power system and water system in Shelby County, {TN}, which includes the city of Memphis, demonstrates the importance of taking infrastructure interactions into account when evaluating the seismic vulnerability and risk to a networked system, as well as the utility of back-up power systems in electric power facilities.},

	abstract = {Multispan continuous steel girder bridges are one of the most common bridge types in the central and southeastern United States. Seismic fragility curves for these highway bridges are essential for risk assessment of highway transportation networks exposed to seismic hazards. This study focuses on developing and comparing fragility curves for seismically and nonseismically designed bridges that are common in this region. The primary differences between seismically and nonseismically designed bridges are the column details and bridge bearings. Detailed three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear analytical models, which account for the nonlinear behavior of the column, girders, and abutments, are developed with the use of the {OpenSees} platform. The fragility curves are developed with a suite of ground motions representative of the seismic hazard in the region. Unlike most previous studies, the fragility curves are developed with geometric variations such as column height, deck width, and length considered to study the effect of these variations on the fragility curves within the same class of bridges. The results provide insight into the level of uncertainty introduced in the analysis of fragility curves for portfolios of bridges with the use of 3-D analytical models and nonlinear time-history analyses. Component and system fragility curves are obtained and are compared for the case of nonseismically and seismically designed bridges.},

Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks.

	abstract = {Recent earthquake disasters have caused major damage to transportation networks, leading to significant economic disruption. While this suggests the need to evaluate total system performance in transportation risk assessment, in addition to examining the vulnerability of individual components such as bridges, no appropriate measures currently exist. This paper develops post-disaster system performance measures and applies them to the urban rail and highway transportation systems in the Kobe, Japan, region devastated by the 1995 {Hyogoken-Nanbu} earthquake. Performance is evaluated in terms of network coverage and transport accessibility. Performance degradation was much more severe for highways and railways than for other lifeline infrastructure systems. Both transportation systems fared poorly in the disaster but service restoration proceeded much more rapidly for rail. The restoration of highway system performance correlated closely with the recovery of highway traffic volumes. The paper further develops a measure of subarea transport accessibility and applies this to Kobe’s constituent city wards. Results indicate substantial spatial disparity that is maintained throughout the restoration period. Comparisons with the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge earthquakes in the {US} show that although these disasters caused notable damage to highway bridges, system performance degradation was small in comparison with the Kobe experience. The paper argues that explicitly measuring transportation system performance can greatly facilitate both understanding the effects of historic disasters and preparing for future hazard events.},

It is thus crucial that avalanche risk assessments are based on a consistent and proper assessment of the uncertainties involved in the modelling of the avalanche run-out zones and the estimations of the damage potential. We link a Bayesian network ({BN)} to a Geographic Information System ({GIS)} for avalanche risk assessment in order to facilitate the explicit modelling of all relevant parameters, their causal relations and the involved uncertainties in a spatially explicit manner. The suggested procedure is illustrated for a case study area (Davos, Switzerland) located in the Swiss Alps. We discuss the potential of such a model by comparing the risks estimated using the probabilistic framework to those obtained by a traditional risk assessment procedure. The presented model may serve as a basis for developing a consistent and unified risk assessment approach.},

To fully assess the potential damage, a linear model was developed to predict {SLR} in Washington, {DC}, and its results compared to other nonlinear model results. Using geographic information systems ({GIS)} and graphical visualization, analytical models were created for the city and its underlying infrastructure. Values of {SLR} used in the assessments were 0.1 m for the year 2043 and 0.4 m for the year 2150 to model short-term {SLR;} 1.0 m, 2.5 m, and 5.0 m were used for long-term {SLR.} All necessary data layers were obtained from free data banks from the {U.S.} Geological Survey and Washington, {DC} government websites. Using {GIS} software, inventories of the possibly affected infrastructure were made at different {SLR.} Results of the analysis show that low {SLR} would lead to a minimal loss of city area. Damages to the local properties, however, are estimated at an assessment value of at least {US\$2} billion based on only the direct losses of properties listed in real estate databases, without accounting for infrastructure damages that include military installations, residential areas, governmental property, and cultural institutions. The projected value of lost property is in excess of {US\$24.6} billion at 5.0 m {SLR.}},

In our experiments, the proposed {SVM} framework outperformed all the other methods tested. In particular, a sensitivity as high as 94\% was achieved by the {SVM} method at an error rate of one false-positive cluster per image.

	abstract = {Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96\% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency ({JMA)} seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the {JMA.}},

This article presents a new model that combines a systems approach with strategies for detecting the internal structure of networks, and providing flexibility and different levels of accuracy in estimating the extent of damage. The model describes networks as hierarchical structures obtained by successive clustering. Hierarchical analysis of networks provides unique insights about how damage affects performance throughout the whole infrastructure system. The model enables using information for decision-making more efficiently by generating different levels of resolution for different problems. This is illustrated using data from hurricane Ike, Texas, {USA} in 2008, where the primary transportation network is studied. Estimates of population affected and loss of productivity are discussed, emphasising the importance of multiple levels for assessment, and their application on fast decision-making for emergency situations.},

This study investigates the spatial correlation of the peak ground motions and the pseudospectral acceleration ({PSA)} responses using the California records and the Chi-Chi records. Because the correlation arises from interevent and intraevent variability, the correlations for individual variability alone and for the combined variability are assessed. The analysis results indicate that the spatial intraevent correlation decreases as the separation distance increases and that the magnitude of the correlation of the {PSA} responses depends on the considered natural vibration periods. The results also indicate that the spatial intraevent correlation of the {PSA} responses for the California records decays more rapidly than that for the Chi-Chi records. Based on the analysis results, a simple empirical equation to predict the spatially varying correlation coefficient of the {PSA} responses, which can be employed in seismic-hazard and seismic-risk assessments, is proposed.},

Such a framework is needed to develop systematic knowledge on how cities recover from disasters. The proposed framework addresses such issues as defining recovery, filtering out exogenous influences unrelated to the disaster, and making comparisons across disparate areas or events. It is applied to document how Kobe City, Japan, recovered from the catastrophic 1995 earthquake. Findings indicate that while aggregate population regained pre-disaster levels in ten years, population had shifted away from the older urban core. Economic recovery was characterised by a three to four year temporary boost in reconstruction activities, followed by settlement at a level some ten per cent below pre-disaster levels. Other long-term effects included substantial losses of port activity and sectoral shifts toward services and large businesses. These patterns of change and disparity generally accelerated pre-disaster trends.},

In our approach, fault rupture is represented kinematically and incorporates spatial heterogeneity in slip, rupture speed, and rise time. The prescribed slip distribution is constrained to follow an inverse wavenumber-squared fall-off and the average rupture speed is set at 80\% of the local shear-wave velocity, which is then adjusted such that the rupture propagates faster in regions of high slip and slower in regions of low slip. We use a Kostrov-like slip-rate function having a rise time proportional to the square root of slip, with the average rise time across the entire fault constrained empirically. Recent observations from large surface rupturing earthquakes indicate a reduction of rupture propagation speed and lengthening of rise time in the near surface, which we model by applying a 70\% reduction of the rupture speed and increasing the rise time by a factor of 2 in a zone extending from the surface to a depth of 5 km. We demonstrate the fidelity of the technique by modeling the strong-motion recordings from the Imperial Valley, Loma Prieta, Landers, and Northridge earthquakes.},

	abstract = {Following the Northridge, California, earthquake of 17 January 1994, the Humboldt Earthquake Education Center ({HEEC)} conducted a telephone survey of approximately 6000 adults from within the felt region to study the earthquake's effects on individual households. We tabulate human responses to the earthquake and observations of the earthquake's effects on inanimate objects from the {HEEC} survey as a function of independently assigned {U.S.} Geological Survey Modified Mercalli ({USGS} {MM)} intensity for the same communities. Human responses and subjective judgments about the severity of shaking, when averaged over a large number of samples, are useful discriminants of the levels of strong ground motion up to those associated with {USGS} {MM} intensity {VII}, notwithstanding that individual human responses and subjective judgments are notoriously unreliable. A threshold of strong ground motion corresponds to {USGS} {MM} intensity of about {VII}, above which over 40\% of respondents described the earthquake as “violent” and most people reported difficulty standing, furniture displaced, and some damage to their homes. Even at intensities {VIII} and {IX}, however, relatively few people (about 15\%) described their reaction as “panic” and only about 12\% reported major damage to their homes. The {HEEC} phone-survey data show that, in communities of low to moderate shaking, {USGS} {MM} intensities estimated from a single postal questionnaire are quite robust. At {USGS} {MM} intensity of V and below, 88\% of {USGS} {MM} intensities determined from postal questionnaires are within one intensity unit of intensities determined from the more numerous {HEEC} telephone survey data for the same community. We introduce the concept of a community decimal intensity scale ({CDI)} based on telephone-survey data and calibrated to agree on average with the {USGS} {MM} intensities. The {CDIs} are more regularly distributed than the {USGS} {MM} intensities and show much less scatter when plotted as a function of epicentral distance. {CDIs} show promise as a tool for comparing regional attenuation, for delineating variations in shaking strength within areas mapped as a single {MM} zone, and for rapid preliminary intensity estimates utilizing electronic media.},

In this paper, a new model for the prediction of Arias intensity, which incorporates nonlinear site response through the use of the average shear-wave velocity and a heteroskedastic variance structure, is proposed. In order to estimate the effects of ground motions on spatially-distributed systems, it is important to take into account the spatial correlation of the intensity measure. However, existing loss-estimation models, which use Ia as an input, do not take this aspect of the ground motion into account. Therefore, the potential to model the spatial correlation of Arias intensity is also investigated. The empirical predictive model is developed using recordings from the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center Next Generation of Attenuation database whereas the model for spatial correlation makes use of the well-recorded events from this database, that is the Northridge and Chi-Chi earthquakes.
